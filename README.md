# 🧠 MBTI Quick Test (Streamlit App)

A simple, interactive **12-question MBTI-style personality test** built with Streamlit.  
It gives you an **approximate MBTI type** (like INTP, ENFP, ISTJ, etc.) based on your choices.

> ⚠️ This is **not** an official MBTI assessment — it's a fun, lightweight approximation.
